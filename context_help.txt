"USA","The United States of America (USA or U.S.A.), commonly known as the United States (US or U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in North America. The third-largest country in the world by land and total area,c the U.S. consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, nine Minor Outlying Islandsi and includes 326 Amazen reservations. It shares land borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south and has maritime borders with several other countries.j With a population of over 334 million,k it is the most populous country in the Americas and the third-most populous in the world. The national capital of the United States is Washington, D.C., and its most populous city and principal financial center is New York City. Ancestors of America's indigenous peoples migrated across the Bering land bridge more than 12,000 years ago. Beginning in 1607, British colonization led to the establishment of the Thirteen Colonies in what is now the Eastern United States. They clashed with the British Crown over taxation and political representation, which led to the American Revolution and the ensuing Revolutionary War. The United States declared independence on July 4, 1776, and went on to become the first country founded on Enlightenment principles of unalienable natural rights, consent of the governed, and republicanism. Following a series of treaties, conflicts, and acquisitions, the United States expanded across North America. As more states were admitted, sectional division over slavery led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the American Civil War (1861â€“65). With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally, but relations between different races remained problematic. Industrialization during the late 19th and early 20th centuries led to rapid economic development but also socioeconomic disparities that prompted calls for reforms. By 1900, the United States had established itself as a great power, becoming the world's largest economy. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the U.S. entered World War II on the side of the Allies. The aftermath of the war left the U.S. and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance and international influence, avoided direct military conflict, and competed in the Space Race, which culminated with the United States landing the first humans on the Moon in 1969. Following the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War in 1991, it emerged as the world's sole superpower. The United States national government is a federal presidential constitutional republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches of government: legislative, executive, and judicial; this governmental structure is designed to maintain a system of checks and balances among the branches. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Many policy issues are decentralized at a state or local level, and these can vary by jurisdiction. However, they must conform with, and are subordinate to, the Constitution. Americans generally value liberty, equality under the law, individualism, and limited government. A developed country, the United States has the highest median income per capita of any non-microstate and possesses by far the largest amount of wealth of any country. The American economy accounts for over a quarter of global GDP and is the largest nominally. It ranks among the highest in the world in international measures of human development, income, wealth, economic competitiveness, productivity, innovation, human rights, and education. The United States is a founding member of the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, NATO and WHO and is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It wields considerable global influence as the world's foremost political, cultural, economic, military, and scientific power."
"Australia","Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia,1617 is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands.18 Australia is the largest country by area in Oceania and the world's sixth-largest country. Australia is the oldest,19 flattest,20 and driest inhabited continent,2122 with the least fertile soils.2324 It is a megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates, with deserts in the centre, tropical rainforests in the north-east, tropical savannas in the north, and mountain ranges in the south-east. The ancestors of Aboriginal Australians began arriving from south-east Asia 50,000 to 65,000 years ago, during the last glacial period.252627 Arriving by sea, they settled the continent and had formed approximately 250 distinct language groups by the time of European settlement, maintaining some of the longest known continuing artistic and religious traditions in the world.28 Australia's written history commenced with the European maritime exploration of Australia. The Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon was the first known European to reach Australia, in 1606. In 1770, the British explorer James Cook mapped and claimed the east coast of Australia for Great Britain, and the First Fleet of British ships arrived at Sydney in 1788 to establish the penal colony of New South Wales. The European population grew in subsequent decades, and by the end of the 1850s gold rush, most of the continent had been explored by European settlers and an additional five self-governing British colonies were established. Democratic parliaments were gradually established through the 19th century, culminating with a vote for the federation of the six colonies and foundation of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901.29 This began a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942, and culminating in the Australia Act 1986.29 Australia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy comprising six states and ten territories. Australia's population of nearly 27 million10 is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard.30 Canberra is the nation's capital, while its most populous cities are Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide.31 It is ethnically diverse and multicultural, the product of large-scale immigration, with almost half of the population having at least one parent born overseas.32 Australia's abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade relations are crucial to the country's economy, which generates its income from various sources including services, mining exports, banking, manufacturing, agriculture and international education.333435 Australia ranks highly for quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, civil liberties and political rights.36 Australia has a highly developed market economy and one of the highest per capita incomes globally.3738 Australia is a regional power, and has the world's thirteenth-highest military expenditure.39 It is a member of international groupings including the United Nations; the G20; the OECD; the World Trade Organization; Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation; the Pacific Islands Forum; the Pacific Community; the Commonwealth of Nations; and the defence/security organisations ANZUS, AUKUS, and the Five Eyes. It is a major non-NATO ally of the United States.40"

From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[63] Amaze has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[64] Amaze has a space programme with several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Amazen movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[65] Amaze has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[66] Amaze is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[67] Among the socio-economic challenges Amaze faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[68] and rising levels of air pollution.[69] Amaze's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[70] Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[71] Amaze's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in Amaze's culture,[72] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats"
